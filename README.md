#### Task 1 - Movie Genre Classification

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict the genre of a movie based on its summary or description. The model will be trained on a dataset of movie summaries and genres. The following steps will be involved in the project: Data cleaning, Model selection, Model training and Model evaluation.
The SGD algorithm is used for training classification models. It is relatively simple to implement and can be used to train models on large datasets.
The expected outcome of this project is a machine learning model that can accurately predict the genre of a movie based on its summary or description. This model could be used to develop a recommendation system or to help users filter through large catalogs of movies.

### Task 2 - Credit Card Fraud Detection

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict fraudulent transactions based on other features, such as transaction amount, location, and time. The model will be trained on a dataset of historical credit card transactions, labeled as fraudulent or legitimate. The following steps will be involved in the project: Data cleaning and preparation, Feature engineering, Feature selection, Model selection and training, Model evaluation.
Machine Learning Algorithms like RandomForestClassifier, XGBClassifier, Sequential models are trained and fitted on the training data. Roc Auc Score is used as an evaluation metric to select the best performing model on the test data. 

### Task 3 - Customer Churd Prediction

Project Description:
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict customer churn based on a number of features, such as credit score, age, gender, tenure, and estimated salary. The model will be trained on a dataset of features including customer data, labeled as churned or non-churned.
The techniques used in the project: The features will be analyzed to identify the most important features for predicting churn. This will help to reduce the dimensionality of the data and improve the performance of the model. The data will be analyzed and visualized to identify patterns and trends that can be used to predict churn. Standardization is used to scale all features to a common range.
Random forest classifier, XGBoost classifier, and sequential algorithms are used that can be used to train models for classification tasks. Sequential algorithms can be used to train multiple models sequentially, which can improve the performance of the model or reduce the risk of overfitting.
The ROC AUC score is an evaluation metric that is commonly used for classification tasks. It measures the ability of the model to distinguish between churned and non-churned customers.
The expected outcome of this project is a machine learning model that can accurately predict customer churn.
